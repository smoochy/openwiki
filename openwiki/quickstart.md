# OpenWiki Quickstart

OpenWiki is a command-line tool that writes and maintains a Markdown wiki for a
codebase or for personal knowledge. A [Deep Agents](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagentsjs)
documentation agent reads your sources, synthesizes a linked wiki you own, and
keeps it current as those sources change. It is built for agents to read as
memory and ships an interactive visualizer for humans to explore.

This page orients a coding agent to the codebase and routes you to the page that
matches your task. Read this first, then follow the links below.

## What OpenWiki is

OpenWiki is published as the `openwiki` npm package, a Node.js (22+) CLI whose
binary resolves to `dist/cli/cli.js`. Its purpose, per the package manifest, is
"a CLI that uses a DeepAgents documentation agent to generate and maintain an
OpenWiki for a codebase." The runtime is a DeepAgents documentation agent driven
by one of several model providers, wrapped by a CLI that can run interactively
(an Ink TUI) or one-shot (print mode).

The CLI has two operating modes:

- **Code** _(default)_ — documents the current repository and writes the wiki to
  `openwiki/` inside the repo.
- **Personal** — documents your connected sources and writes to
  `~/.openwiki/wiki`.

## Developer workflow

OpenWiki is a pnpm + TypeScript project. The commands you will use most:

```sh
pnpm install          # install dependencies
pnpm run build        # tsc (server + client) then copy visualizer assets
pnpm run dev          # run the CLI from source via tsx (src/cli/cli.tsx)
pnpm run coverage     # run the Vitest suite with coverage
pnpm test             # typecheck + build + coverage (the full CI-equivalent gate)
```

`pnpm run dev` executes the TypeScript entrypoint directly with `tsx`, while the
shipped binary runs the compiled `dist/cli/cli.js`. Before opening a PR, run
`pnpm run format`, `pnpm run lint`, and `pnpm test`; `format` and `lint` mirror
the per-PR checks and `test` typechecks, builds, and runs Vitest with coverage.

To exercise the CLI against another local repository, link the package globally
(`pnpm link --global`) or alias `openwiki` to `node /path/to/openwiki/dist/cli/cli.js`,
then run it from the target repo's working directory.

## Entrypoint and control flow

The process entrypoint is `src/cli/cli.tsx`. It installs a crash guard before any
run so escaped rejections are recorded with telemetry, parses the argument vector
into a command, and dispatches:

- `integrations` and `mcp` commands go to the host-integration surface
  (`runIntegrationsCommand` / `runMcpCommand`).
- All other commands run through `runStandardCommand`, the native pipeline, which
  loads environment, resolves the startup command, decides once whether this is
  the first run (mints the install id), and then either prints a startup error,
  runs non-interactively in print mode, or renders the interactive Ink `App`.

The `dev` script points at this same `.tsx` file, so behavior is identical
between `pnpm run dev` and the built binary.

> **Behavioral change operators hit first:** an unrecognized `--language` value
> (for example a misspelled locale or a bare language name) is now rejected at
> parse time as a parse error rather than silently generating an English wiki.
> `parseCommand` classifies the flag via `resolveLanguage` and, on an
> `unrecognized` result, returns an `error` command with the user-facing
> message before any run work or persisted state is touched. The full command
> and flag reference lives in
> [CLI Reference](/openwiki/operations/cli-reference.md).

## Task-routing map

Find your task on the left, then read the page on the right. This routes you to
the canonical wiki pages; each one links into the deeper source map.

## Where OpenWiki keeps its state

- **Repository (code) wiki:** written to `openwiki/` in the repo, alongside the
  structured Claims sidecar under `openwiki/.claims/` and in-progress run state
  in `openwiki/.run.json`.
- **Local state:** credentials, the personal wiki, connector data, conversation
  history, and skills live under `~/.openwiki` by default; set
  `OPENWIKI_CONFIG_DIR` to relocate to a different writable directory.

Repository (code) generation follows the resumable page-job flow
`begin → submit_plan → next_page → submit_page → … → finish`, with the
non-mutating `inspect_page_claims` available on demand inside `generating` for a
worker that needs the complete current Claim set before intentionally revising
or removing otherwise-current content. Each page job has
a `PageJobStatus` of `pending`, `skipped`, or `complete`. A worker that fails or
exits without submitting its page is marked `skipped` and rolled back to its
pre-worker state so completed pages are not lost; the run can still `finish` once
every remaining job is `complete` or `skipped`, and a resumed run resets skipped
jobs back to `pending` so they are re-attempted. In-progress runs are recorded in
`openwiki/.run.json`; on a persistent checkout, an interrupted run resumes the
durable page queue, while ephemeral CI runners start fresh after failure unless
their workspace is preserved. An update whose Claims preflight is clean, source
fingerprint is unchanged, and every existing page has complete baseline coverage
is proven a strict no-op at `begin` time and skips model invocation.

Finalization is deterministic and runs once. `finishRepositoryRun` refuses to
finish while any page job is still `pending`, validates that every `skipped` job
carries its original page snapshot, restores skipped pages to their pre-worker
Markdown and Claims, persists and proves the reconciled Claims durable, and only
then removes `openwiki/.run.json` — so any earlier failure leaves the run
resumable. If repository source changed while OpenWiki was running (detected by
re-fingerprinting the source before and after finalization), the run finalizes
without advancing the source checkpoint and writes `interrupted` update metadata
instead of `complete`, prompting a follow-up `openwiki --update` to reconcile the
drift.

## Host-driven generation

OpenWiki can also run inside a host coding agent (Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode,
or Cursor) instead of launching its own model. The integration shares one
canonical skill and the same six MCP operations as native generation:
`openwiki_begin`, `openwiki_submit_plan`, `openwiki_next_page`, optional on-demand
`openwiki_inspect_page_claims`, `openwiki_submit_page`, and `openwiki_finish`. The
host owns repository research, planning, and factual authoring; OpenWiki owns the
durable queue, Claims reconciliation, source-drift handling, and deterministic
finalization. Host-driven runs currently support repository code wikis (not
personal brains), use the host's authenticated model session, and use repository
source and tests only — connector context (including LangSmith) is not yet
supported. The host submits only sparse Claim decisions for each page
(`confirmedClaimIds` for rechecked issue Claims kept unchanged, `claims` for
revisions and additions, `retractedClaimIds` for removals); OpenWiki
automatically retains current issue-free Claims and makes the full Claim set
available through on-demand `openwiki_inspect_page_claims` for broad rewrites.
See [Coding-Agent Integrations](/openwiki/integrations/coding-agents.md) for
install scope, the host registry, and the host-driven lifecycle boundary.
